# Introduction 
This project is do find similarity between two images. It uses the deep learning features of OpenCV and is developed by following the guide of PyImageSearch.
It uses the pre-trained Caffe deep learning model provided by OpenCV to detect faces.
The face recognition model OpenCV uses to compute the 128-d face embeddings comes from the [OpenFace project](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/)
